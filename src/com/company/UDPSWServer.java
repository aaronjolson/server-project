/*
* The information provided in the receiverâ€™s window should include (fixed width output), for each datagram received:

Static text

if first time datagram is being received: [RECV]

if duplicate datagram received: [DUPL]

datagram received time in milliseconds

Sequence number of the received data datagram

Condition of data Datagram

if datagram is corrupt: [CRPT]

if datagram is received out of sequence: [!Seq]

if datagram is good: [RECV]

For each ACK datagram, decision for the ACK: [DROP|SENT|ERR]
Use the same rules as the Sender.

Representative Examples (not intended to be complete):

Datagram 1 was received successfully
RECV 100234456 1 RECV

Datagram 1 was received a second time (duplicate)
DUPL 111234456 1 !Seq

Datagram 1 was received but with an error
RECV 100234456 1 CRPT

ACK for Datagram 1 was created and sent successfully
SENDing ACK 1 100234456 SENT

ACK for Datagram 1 was created but was dropped by the network
SENDing ACK 1 100234456 DROP

ACK for Datagram 1 was created but was corrupted by the network
SENDing ACK 1 100234456 ERR

[RECV|DUPL]
[RECV|!Seq|CRPT]
[SENT|DROP|ERR]
